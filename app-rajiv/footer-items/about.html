		<h3>Oktpus vs. Traditional:</h3>
		<div class="content-data-about">
			<span>
				Since the 1990's, hundreds of car search sites have emerged. We label these websites as traditional automotive classified sites and for the sake of 
			</span>
			<span class="right-para">
				brevity, we'll call them "Traditional." So what makes Oktpus different from Traditional?

		<div class="content-data-about">
			<span>
				Oktpus does not capture and sell car shopper personal information.<br><br>Oktpus is not in the business of capturing and reselling car shopper private information. Oktpus simply presents a deep link directly to where it 
			</span>
			<span class="right-para">
				found the vehicle's detail page (VDP). This process enables the car shopper to go directly to the source of vehicle classified information. So, unlike other classified sites, Oktpus does not monetize itself by hijacking the buying process.
